Modified by Tim Blythman December 2015 to work with newer (1.58 and later) versions of Arduino that need PROGMEM variables set as consts.

Changes:
all phrases modified to const PROGMEM from PROGMEM

say function changed to const uint8_t from uint8_t


Future changes:
need to add function definitons and prototypes for uint8_t back in, so content in RAM can be accessed.
